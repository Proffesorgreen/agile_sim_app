# AASTU library Management System

## 1. Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the practical application of **Agile Project Management** principles using **Jira** and **GitHub**. The system is the AASTU library Management System — a platform that allows students to register, search for books, borrow and return them, and view their borrowing history. librarians can manage the book catalogue, monitor active borrowings and overdue items, and access library usage analytics.

The project is built and managed using the **Scrum** framework across two 2-week sprints, with a full backlog, sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives simulated throughout.

> **Note:** The emphasis of this project is on Agile processes — sprint planning, backlog management, feature branching, pull request reviews, and iterative releases — rather than programming complexity.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

This project fulfils the following Agile PM objectives:

- Define and manage a **Product Backlog** with Epics, User Stories, and Story Points
- Plan and execute **two Scrum Sprints** with clear Sprint Goals
- Apply a disciplined **Git branching strategy** (one feature branch per Jira ticket)
- Use **Pull Requests with peer review** as the merge gate for all code changes
- Integrate **Jira with GitHub** so commits and PRs are linked to tickets automatically
- Conduct and document all **Scrum ceremonies** — Planning, Standup, Review, Retrospective
- Produce **two GitHub Releases** (v1.0.0 and v1.1.0) with structured changelogs
- Maintain a live **STANDUP.md** log throughout both sprints

---

## 3. System Scope

The AASTU library Management System includes:

- Member registration and authentication (login, logout, OTP password recovery)
- Book search by title, author, or ISBN
- Book detail view with availability and copy count
- Borrow and return book workflow with due date tracking
- librarian tools: add books to catalogue, view all active borrowings and overdue items
- Member dashboard showing current borrowings and due dates
- library analytics: most borrowed books and peak usage times
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile

## 6. Agile & Git Workflow

### Scrum Framework

This project follows the Scrum framework with two 2-week sprints:

| Sprint | Goal | Story Points | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sprint 1 | Member can register, log in, search books, borrow and return | 16 pts | 2 weeks |
| Sprint 2 | OTP recovery, DTrarian tools, analytics dashboard, tests, release | 24 pts | 2 weeks |

### Branching Strategy

| Branch Type | Pattern | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | `main` | Stable and release-ready — never commit directly |
| Feature | `feature/DT-XX-short-description` | One branch per Jira ticket |
| Docs | `docs/DT-description` | Documentation-only updates |
| Hotfix | `hotfix/DT-XX-description` | Urgent fixes on released code |

### Commit Message Convention

**Format:** `type(scope): DT-XX short description`

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature (user story) | `feat(auth): DT-1 add member registration form` |
| `fix` | Bug fix | `fix(books): DT-8 correct copy count on return` |
| `test` | Tests added or updated | `test(auth): DT-14 add unit tests for login` |
| `docs` | Documentation only | `docs(retro): add Sprint 1 retrospective` |
| `style` | UI / CSS only | `style(dashboard): DT-13 apply responsive layout` |
| `chore` | Config / setup | `chore(repo): add .gitignore` |

### Pull Request Rules

- Every Jira ticket gets **one feature branch** and **one PR**
- PRs must reference the Jira ticket: `Closes DT-XX`
- PRs require **at least one peer review approval** before merging
- Authors may **not** approve their own PRs
- Branch is **deleted** after merge

## 7. Jira Backlog & Sprint Management

**Jira Project:** AASTU library Agile Sim (`DT`)  
**Jira URL:** `[https://ermiasyohannes262.atlassian.net/]`  
**Integration:** GitHub for Jira — commits, branches, and PRs auto-link to tickets

### Epics

| Epic | Tickets | Colour |

## 10. Scrum Ceremonies

### Sprint Planning
Held at the start of each sprint. The Product Owner presents the sprint goal and proposes stories. The team estimates, negotiates scope, and commits to a sprint backlog. Sprint goal and assignments are recorded in `docs/sprint_plans/`.

### Daily Standup
Held every working day. Each member answers:
1. What did I complete since the last standup?
2. What will I work on today?
3. Do I have any blockers?

### Sprint Review
Held at the end of each sprint. Each team member demos their completed stories live. The Product Owner accepts or rejects each story against its acceptance criteria. Outcomes are recorded in `docs/sprint_plans/sprintX_review.md`.

### Sprint Retrospective
Held after the Sprint Review. The team reflects using Start / Stop / Continue format and commits to 1–2 concrete process improvements for the next sprint. Outcomes are recorded in `docs/retrospectives/sprintX_retro.md`.
